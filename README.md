# Desperado  
This is my personal project for real-time ray tracing.  
The goal of the project is to denoise Monte-Carlo path traced images with low sample counts.

## Methods  
 - SVGF (Spatiotemporal Variance Guided Filtering)

### Features
 - Using OpenGL to generate primary visibility and to implement SVGF. Secondary and shadow rays are traced using OptiX.
 - Separation of albedo, direct lighting, and indirect lighting channels.
 - Spatial wavelet filtering -- taking into account normals, color edges, and depth/world-position differences.
 - Temporal accumulation -- Accumulation of color from previous frames, and variance estimation (to improve edge blurring).
 - Motion vectors -- reprojection to match up points across frames, even w/ movement.

### TODO
 - Add TAA in the final stage of rendering.
 - Find a Tone mapping method.
